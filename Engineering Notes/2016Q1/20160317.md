# Framework
* Scalability seems fine, 15K disk 2 sec for queries, scales linearly to 30k disks
    * To be tested with real volumes
* Stas to Redis will be there end end of the month (ALBA and voldrv still need to do that)
*  Logs still need to be tackled by all teams
*  Framework part for the Edge still needs to be discussed:

# Volumedriver
* Edge
    * Step 1 block device across network
    * Step 2 (later) add authentication, failover, configuration
    * Device : ovs+RDMA://vol1/IP of portal:port or vpool? To be decided.

# ALBA
* RDMA
    * Both libs are not really working
    * Accelerated alba, still few items to do . eviction (now random later lru)
* Exposing stats for the xtra alba
* Whats the limit in case of alba on flash
    * gets/puts single SSD and 12 SSDs
* Still todo prefetching manifest - for both tiers store everything in RAM (later)
    * Store manifest uncompressed for now
* Spreading data across a datacenter is a higher priority
* Next arakoon across wide network latency 20 msec
